This repository contains materials and code examples from the DeepLearning.AI short course **"Building AI Browser Agents"**, taught by **Div Garg** and **Naman Garg**, Co-founders of AGI, Inc.

## 📚 Course Overview

AI browser agents can automate complex web tasks like logging into websites, filling out forms, navigating through pages, and even placing online orders. These agents leverage both visual information (screenshots) and structural data (HTML/DOM) to understand web pages, reason about appropriate actions, and execute them.

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to building robust and reliable AI browser agents, exploring their architecture, capabilities, limitations, and the advanced decision-making strategies that power them.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Fundamentals of autonomous web agents including their architecture, key components, limitations, and decision-making strategies
- How to build web agents that can scrape websites and structure outputs based on natural language instructions
- Techniques for creating autonomous web agents that can execute multiple tasks sequentially
- The AgentQ framework and how it enables agents to self-correct through:
  - Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
  - Self-critique mechanisms
  - Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
- Current state and future directions of AI agents
